# Milestone 4 : *Customizable Sliding Puzzle Game*

Submitted by: **Team AAA&L**

This web app: **is built with React, Vite, and JavaScript. It is a customizable sliding puzzle game supporting seamless switching between 8-puzzle (3x3 grid) and 15-puzzle (4x4 grid) modes, with intuitive click controls for tile movement, move tracking, win detection, high scores, and responsive design for all devices. The game ensures puzzles are always solvable and offers simple, clear visuals suitable for all ages.**

Time spent: **109.75 hours** at 30 dollars per hour [total: $3292.50]

## Notes

During this build process, we focused on modular code structure for team collaboration, ensuring solvability with parity checks, and optimizing for performance. Key challenges included debugging import paths  and Vite caching that significantly led to the breakdown our our project during presentation.However, the project strengthened our software engineering skills in React state management and UI responsiveness.
